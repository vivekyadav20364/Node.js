In Node.js, the term "fork" is commonly associated with the child_process module, and specifically, the fork method within that module. 
This method is used to create a new Node.js process, often referred to as a "child process," which runs in a separate V8 engine instance. 
The primary use case for forking is to run multiple instances of a script concurrently.

Child Process: When you fork a process using child_process.fork, it creates a new Node.js process that is an independent instance of the V8 engine.

Communication: The parent and child processes can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC). This allows data to be sent and received between the parent and child processes.

Use Cases: Forking is commonly used for scenarios where parallel execution of tasks is beneficial, such as running multiple workers to perform computationally intensive operations concurrently.

Here's a basic example:

javascript
Copy code
// parent.js
const { fork } = require('child_process');

// Fork a child process
const childProcess = fork('child.js');

// Send data to the child process
childProcess.send({ message: 'Hello from parent' });

// Listen for messages from the child process
childProcess.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Parent received:', message);
});
javascript
Copy code
// child.js
process.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Child received:', message);

  // Send a response back to the parent process
  process.send({ reply: 'Hello from child' });
});
In this example:

The parent.js script forks a child process (child.js).
The parent sends a message to the child process.
The child process receives the message, logs it, and sends a reply back to the parent.
The parent process listens for messages from the child and logs the reply.
